# irlp-web-console

A web-based console / remote control for IRLP nodes

Loosely inspired by IRLPvCON by K6IB (SK), but re written from scratch as a "Web 2.0" app under a more permissive license, irlp-web-console aims to be an easy-to-install easy-to-use web-based remote-control, monitor, and home page for IRLP nodes.
